I prefer the location in the Strip, but was happy to see they had opened something downtown, which I caught completely by chance as I was walking around looking for lunch.  I got my old standby, the spicy tuna sandwich (formerly the Navajo) and it was just as delicious as ever.  I can't comment on the sushi since I have never had it, but if looks mean anything, it certainly LOOKS excellent.",

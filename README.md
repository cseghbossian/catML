# catML
A Machine Learning project to predict star ratings from Yelp reviews.

TO DOs:
Clean and comment each model's code
Angelina -> Turn the the client ipynb into a python ipynb file that accepts in the command line a test set and will output a predictions file

Everyone -> Add accuracy measurements in the report for each model they ran

Celine -> Any visuals would be helpful

Files that need to be kept in the zip file along with the code:
pickled_feature_vectorizer
pickled_svm
pickled_perceptron
pickled_nc
pickled_logistic_regression
